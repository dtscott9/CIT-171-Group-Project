        <h1>How Individuals and Families can Practice Internet Safety</h1>
        
        <p>"
            The Internet is a wonderful tool and resource for families, but caution must be exercised in 
            order to protect families and individuals from the potential dangers that are present online.” - LDS Services <sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/pornography/audiences/individuals/internet-safety?lang=eng#:~:text=The%20Internet%20is%20a%20wonderful,dangers%20that%20are%20present%20online." id="res2">2</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Though it may seem very discouraging and hopeless to some hearing about the different terms such as 
            “spam”, “hacker” or “virus” there is actually plenty you can do as an individual to protect yourself 
            and your family in the online world. There is an old saying that says that knowledge is the best 
            defense, and if you put in practice the knowledge you learn about staying safe on the internet, you
            will safer than you have before.

        <h1>Threat Actors</h1>
        <p>A threat actor is someone that has intent to cause harm or commit criminal activity online. This might 
        include stealing someone’s personal info, locking or stealing important files on one’s computer for a 
        ransom, or by falsely advertising a real product with intent of stealing one’s credit card info.</p>
        <p>Many people refer to threat actors as “hackers” or simply people that know computer so well that they 
        can steal people’s info with just the click of a mouse. Though there are certainly people with that can 
        write malicious code to do things like that, a lot of “hacking” is done by people who use mental techniques 
        to try and manipulate or trick people into giving up the info or access themselves. This is known as social 
        engineering.</p>
        
        <h1>What to Look out for</h1>
        <p>An example of social engineering might be someone who is messaging you on Facebook asking for money. They 
            might be acting as if they were someone in need, or they may even be posing as a family member or friend, 
            but are using a fake account. Though it’s important to help those in need, and especially be there for family 
            members and friends, it’s also important to verify that the person actually needs help and they are not just 
            trying to scam you. If they are posing as a family member or friend, it would be beneficial to contact that 
            person directly to make sure it was actually them who sent the message.</p>
        <p>There may be instances where someone may not be reaching out to you, but you may come across an ad or an email 
            that says you are a lucky winner, or that you can win a free ipad by completing a survey for example. If it 
            seems too good to be true, it is almost certainly too good to be true. Most of these ads or emails will lead 
            you to download a type of software called malware. If downloaded onto your computer, malware can cause 
            important data to be deleted or stolen.
            A virus is a type of malware that can damage, erase, or reformat your 
            hard drive. <sup><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-computer-has-a-virus-what-to-do-about-it/#:~:text=A%20virus%20can%20damage%20programs,steal%20or%20destroy%20your%20data.">3</a></sup></p>

        <h1>How to help your kids practice internet safety</h1>
        <p>
            Nowadays, kids are all over the internet, using social media and playing games online. Unfortunately, 
            there are many people who like to trick kids or act as potential friends with the intention of getting 
            them to reveal personal information such as what school they go to or what their home address is. It is 
            important to teach your kids to not give away any sensitive information without your permission. 
            Another thing that might be beneficial in helping your kids with online safety is to put the computer 
            in an open high traffic area such as the kitchen or family room where they usually won’t be by 
            themselves. <sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/pornography/audiences/individuals/internet-safety?lang=eng#:~:text=The%20Internet%20is%20a%20wonderful,dangers%20that%20are%20present%20online.">2</a></sup>

        <p class="quote">
            “The Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see John 16:13). He enlightens our 
            minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all 
            truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers to 
            us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” John 14:26.</p>
        <p class="quote">"For these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the 
            companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek 
            after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if 
            we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and 
            His Son, Jesus Christ.” -Come Follow Me</p>

            <p>Be careful, and make sure to remember, threat actors are always evolving with more and more 
                information available to them. One example is a cracked password list. There are many lists on the 
                internet that contain passwords that've been “hacked” or found by cracking into company’s databases, 
                personal social media accounts, and from many other places.</p>
            <p>This is an article that introduces us to the largest known list containing more than 1.5 BILLION 
                passwords for threat actors to use and harm others’ private information.</p>
