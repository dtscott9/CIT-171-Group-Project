        <h1>How Individuals and Families can Practice Internet Safety</h1>
        
        <p>"
            The Internet is a wonderful tool and resource for families, but caution must be exercised in 
            order to protect families and individuals from the potential dangers that are present online.‚Äù - LDS Services <sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/pornography/audiences/individuals/internet-safety?lang=eng#:~:text=The%20Internet%20is%20a%20wonderful,dangers%20that%20are%20present%20online." id="res2">2</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Though it may seem very discouraging and hopeless to some hearing about the different terms such as 
            ‚Äúspam‚Äù, ‚Äúhacker‚Äù or ‚Äúvirus‚Äù there is actually plenty you can do as an individual to protect yourself 
            and your family in the online world. There is an old saying that says that knowledge is the best 
            defense, and if you put in practice the knowledge you learn about staying safe on the internet, you
            will be safer than you have before while surfing the web. 
        </p>

        <h1>Threat Actors</h1>
        <p>A threat actor is someone that has intent to cause harm or commit criminal activity online. This might 
        include stealing someone‚Äôs personal info, locking or stealing important files on one‚Äôs computer for a 
        ransom, or falsely advertising a real product with intent of stealing one‚Äôs credit card info.</p>
        <p>Many people refer to threat actors as ‚Äúhackers‚Äù or simply people that know computers so well that they 
        can steal people‚Äôs info with just the click of a mouse. Though there are certainly people that can 
        write malicious code to do things like that, a lot of ‚Äúhacking‚Äù is done by people who use mental techniques 
        to try and manipulate or trick people into giving up the info or access themselves. This is known as social 
        engineering.</p>
        
        <h1>What to Look out for</h1>
        <p>An example of social engineering might be someone who is messaging you on Facebook asking for money. They 
            might be acting as if they were someone in need, or they may even be posing as a family member or friend, 
            but are using a fake account. Though it‚Äôs important to help those in need, and especially be there for family 
            members and friends, it‚Äôs also important to verify that the person actually needs help and they are not just 
            trying to scam you. If they are posing as a family member or friend, it would be beneficial to contact that 
            person directly to make sure it was actually them who sent the message.</p>
        <p>There may be instances where someone may not be reaching out to you, but you may come across an ad or an email 
            that says you are a lucky winner, or that you can win a free ipad by completing a survey for example. If it 
            seems too good to be true, it is almost certainly too good to be true. Most of these ads or emails will lead 
            you to download a type of software called malware. If downloaded onto your computer, malware can cause 
            important data to be deleted or stolen.
            A virus is a type of malware that can damage, erase, or reformat your 
            hard drive. <sup><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-computer-has-a-virus-what-to-do-about-it/#:~:text=A%20virus%20can%20damage%20programs,steal%20or%20destroy%20your%20data.">3</a></sup>
            There may be times where a virus or scam isn't always obvious. A good defense against this is to simply have
            backups for your important files. This could be on a cloud service or a device such as a USB or SD card.</p>

        <h1>How to help your kids practice internet safety</h1>
        <p>
            Nowadays, kids are all over the internet, using social media and playing games online. Unfortunately, 
            there are many people who like to trick kids or act as potential friends with the intention of getting 
            them to reveal personal information such as what school they go to or what their home address is. It is 
            important to teach your kids to not give away any sensitive information without your permission. 
            Another thing that might be beneficial in helping your kids with online safety is to put the computer 
            in an open high traffic area such as the kitchen or family room where they usually won‚Äôt be by 
            themselves. <sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/pornography/audiences/individuals/internet-safety?lang=eng#:~:text=The%20Internet%20is%20a%20wonderful,dangers%20that%20are%20present%20online.">2</a></sup>

        <p class="quote">
            ‚ÄúThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see John 16:13). He enlightens our 
            minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all 
            truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers to 
            us ways to do this. Truly, ‚Äúthe Holy Ghost ‚Ä¶ shall teach [us] all things‚Äù John 14:26.</p>
        <p class="quote">"For these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the 
            companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek 
            after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away‚Äîfor we know that if 
            we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and 
            His Son, Jesus Christ.‚Äù -Come Follow Me<sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-individuals-and-families-old-testament-2022/intro?lang=eng">1</a></sup></p>

        <h1>Making Strong Passwords</h1>
        <h2>VIDEO</h2>
        <p>For kids and all ages. If the youngest family member in your family is pre-teenage years, or you have a large family 
            group, we recommend watching this video.</p>
            <iframe width="500" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LxdtaSvQ3I"></iframe>
            <p>For Teens and older family members.

        <h2>ACTIVITY</h2>
        <p>Now that we have watched the video, how can your family members make stronger passwords? You can go to 
        this website to find out how fast it takes for a computer to crack what you type in, if it was a 
        password.<br>

        <p>Be careful, and make sure to remember, threat actors are always evolving with more and more 
            information available to them. One example is a cracked password list. There are many lists on the 
            internet that contain passwords that've been ‚Äúhacked‚Äù or found by cracking into company‚Äôs databases, 
            personal social media accounts, and from many other places.</p>
        <p>This is an article that introduces us to the largest known list containing more than 1.4 BILLION 
            passwords for threat actors to use and harm others‚Äô private information.</p>

        <h1>Backing up Your Data</h1>
        <p>
        This video explores the different types of storage devices we‚Äôre familiar with.</p>
        <iframe width="500" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVG48F-zqPM"></iframe>
        <h2>ACTIVITY</h2>
        <p>Scavenger hunt!<br>
            What storage devices do you have around your home? Take 1-3 min for the family to go around the house and bring different types of storage devices!
            </p>
        <img src="images/easter_eggs.jpeg" alt="easter eggs">
        <p>Storage devices are all around us. We need them to keep all the texts, memos, pictures, apps, and any data in 
            our home, it all needs a place to stay. These physical devices in our home help us keep all the information we 
            want to save, but there‚Äôs also a new technology that is becoming more and more popular and accessible to us. 
            It‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù.</p>
        <h2>Videos for kids and all ages</h2>
        <p>Cloud explained by kids! This is an adorable video of kids trying to explain the cloud.</p>
        <iframe width="500" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ad-NTOuye4I"></iframe>
        <p>What‚Äôs ‚Äúcloud computing?‚Äù This video explains very simply what happens when we upload our pictures 
        ‚Äúto the cloud‚Äù.</p>
        <iframe width="500" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTNgV0O_oTg"></iframe>
        <h2>ACTIVITY</h2>
        <p>After watching both videos, just like the kids in the first video, try and draw a graph of how a cloud 
            might work when we upload(send it to a different computer from your computer) data on the internet.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs essential to backup our data! When you backup data(pictures, texts, any saved information on your 
            devices) manually, you can purchase another storage device and copy all of it, or some parts of your 
            main storage device. That could be expensive but it‚Äôs effective. Cloud is a very useful method of 
            storing data! Any device that‚Äôs supported can access these clouds, and because it‚Äôs not limited to one 
            storage device in our device, we can access it on our Computer at home, at work, our smartphones, and 
            even on these toasters.</p>
            <img src="images/smart_toaster.jpeg" alt="smart toaster"/>
            <p>Discuss with your family about moments where you lost something, it doesn‚Äôt have to be data. 
            Say if you forgot your travel bag at the airport when you hopped on a plane!! Or you lost your favorite family 
            picture. Wouldn‚Äôt it make you feel safer if you had an extra travel bag with the exact same things inside? Or 
            multiple copies of that same family picture? Backing up data is doing exactly that, but with your important 
            informations you keep on different devices.

        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <p>Read these paragraphs from Fortifying Our Homes for The Latter-days<sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2019/06/nzl-eng-local-pages/local-news-001?lang=eng">7</a></sup></p>
        <p class="quote">‚ÄúIn Alma 50:1‚Äì4, Mormon explains how Captain Moroni built fortifications to protect his people 
            from physical bondage. Please pay particular attention to references such as ‚Äòdigging up heaps of earth, 
            timbers, frame of pickets and towers.‚Äô</p>
        <p class="quote">In the spirit of Nephi‚Äôs counsel to, ‚Äòliken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for 
            our profit and learning,‚Äô2 I believe Captain Moroni‚Äôs fortifications and strategies to avoid physical 
            bondage in 72 B.C. are insightful as we look to fortify our own homes and families in these latter days.</p>
        <p class="quote">Like Captain Moroni, who did not stop making preparations to defend his people from their 
            enemies (Amalickiah), President Nelson in our day continues to seek revelation from the Lord to defend us 
            from our enemy (Satan). The digging of heaps of earth to protect the city was a physical labour. Can you 
            imagine the many hours of extreme physical exertion the people of Moroni would have gone through to do 
            what they did? All without the aid of modern excavating equipment we have at our disposal today. 
            The heaps of earth we are required to dig in order to fortify our homes today require spiritual exertion. 
            It will take faith and work, humility, obedience, love, unity, diligence, commitment, prayer and charity 
            to mention only some Christlike attributes.‚Äù - Fortifying our Homes in The Latter-days</p>
        <p>With all the learning you and your family were able to take away from this lesson, take some time to discuss 
        how these paragraphs could correlate with bringing security to our information online.</p>
        <p><br>
            Tips for the discussion:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How did Moroni tackle the upcoming threats they would face? Was it easy?</li>
            <li>Why is this similar to how we prepare for the worst that could happen online?</li>
            <li>How does the scriptures help us with keeping our information safe?</li>
            <li>Why would our Heavenly Father want us to learn CyberSecurity?</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Additional Resources</h1>
        <p> 
        As we prepare with caution, and with all the information available for us, we can be ready to treat actors 
        that are actively trying to find out who we are, and harm us on the internet. Elder Bednar invited us to 
        use the internet as tools to share the gospel.<sup><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2015/08/youth/flood-the-earth-through-social-media?lang=eng">12</a></sup>

        <p class="quote">‚ÄúImagine the impact we can have as hundreds of thousands and millions of members of the Lord‚Äôs 
            restored Church contribute in seemingly small ways to the rising floodwaters. May our many small, individual
             efforts produce a steady rainfall of righteousness and truth that gradually swells a multitude of streams 
             and rivers‚Äîand ultimately becomes a flood that sweeps the earth. ‚ÄúWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, 
             for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great‚Äù (D&C 64:33).‚Äù</p>
             <p>We are to use the internet as a tool to share the Gospel. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs an easy and always secure 
                 environment. He continues in the same talk saying,</p>
             <p class="quote">‚ÄúWe have been and are blessed in so many ways; and where much is given, much is required. I pray 
                 that you may come to understand more fully the spiritual significance and blessing of living in the 
                 dispensation of the fulness of times, that you may have eyes to see clearly both the possibilities and the 
                 pitfalls of the remarkable technologies that are available to us today, that you may increase in your capacity 
                 to use these inspired tools appropriately, and that you may receive inspiration and guidance about the role you 
                 should play in helping to sweep the earth as with a flood of truth and righteousness. As you press forward in 
                 this holy work, I promise you will be blessed in mortality in the individual, specific, and necessary ways that 
                 will prepare you for eternity.‚Äù</p>
            <p>As God‚Äôs children, much is required from us to share the Gospel throughout our lives. We promise you that as you 
                increase your CyberSecurity, you will have much more freedom in our technology laced day to day lives, and 
                Gospel sharing opportunities.</p>
